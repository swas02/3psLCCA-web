# HTML report — proposal and sample

_Status: implemented with page preview and page numbering (Paged.js). Sample PDF: `npm run report:sample` → `report-samples/M_20_2L_OF_S_HTML_Report.pdf`._

## The problem with today's report

The web app currently produces the report by running the desktop app's own
LaTeX pipeline inside the browser: a Python runtime (Pyodide + pandas +
matplotlib) generates the `.tex`, and a pdfTeX compiler built to WebAssembly
typesets it. That gives a byte-for-byte desktop-identical PDF, but at a price:

| | LaTeX-in-browser (current) | HTML report (proposed) |
|---|---|---|
| First-use download | **~60 MB** (Python runtime + TeX Live) | **~0.8 MB** (fonts, math renderer, paginator — loaded only on the Report page) |
| Time to report (reference project, warm) | **~8–18 s** | **~1 s** to display; **~2.5 s** to lay out pages; **~1 s** to print to PDF |
| Memory while generating | two WebAssembly runtimes, hundreds of MB | ordinary web page |
| Works on a 4 GB laptop | borderline; can stall or fail | yes — it is just a web page |
| Readable in the browser before downloading | no (PDF only) | **yes** — it is a page you scroll, then print if you want a file |
| PDF output | generated file, auto-downloaded | browser **Print → Save as PDF** |

Measured on the M_20_2L_OF_S reference project (headless Chromium): the HTML
report renders in about 1.2 s, the page preview lays out 34 A4 pages in about
2.6 s, and printing to PDF takes about 1.1 s. The LaTeX report of the same
project is 38 pages and took 15–25 s.

## How it works

Nothing new is computed. The report reads the **same data the LaTeX pipeline
reads** — the project converted to desktop "chunks" by the existing, golden-
tested mapper (`reportChunks.js`) plus the calculation results — and lays it
out as an ordinary web page styled to look like the LaTeX document (Latin
Modern fonts, numbered sections, booktabs-style tables). Charts are drawn by
the same code as the Results page; equations in Appendix B are the desktop's
own LaTeX formulas rendered by KaTeX.

The report opens directly as real A4 pages laid out in the browser (Paged.js,
~300 KB, loaded on demand; pages appear as they are laid out, about 2.5 s for
the whole reference project on a laptop): title page without a number, contents / list of tables / list of
figures on roman-numbered pages with page numbers and dotted leaders, the body
numbered from 1 with a running header (project name on the left, report title
on the right) and the page number in the footer, and Appendix C on a landscape
page. What is shown is exactly what **Print / Save as PDF** writes.

Every number is checked against the desktop report: `tests/reportDocument.test.js`
pins values straight from the LaTeX golden (`m20-report.golden.tex`) — bridge
and financial fields, construction totals and source markers, material,
transport, machinery and recycling tables, the full results table with stage
totals and grand total, the summary percentages, and the WPI appendix.

Where to find it: **Results → View Report**, or the **Report** entry in the
project sidebar. The **Sections…** button reuses the existing section picker.

## What is the same as the desktop report

- Section structure and order: title page, contents, introduction with the
  3PS-LCC framework figure, all input-data sections (bridge, financial,
  construction, maintenance, traffic, environmental, recycling), LCCA results
  table and figures, summary and conclusions, Appendices A, B and C.
- Every table's columns, row order, grouping, captions and intro sentences.
- All values and their formatting (2 decimals, thousands separators; 4-decimal
  WPI ratios; em-dash for missing values), the construction source markers
  (†, #, §, ‡) and legend, exclusion reasons, "Reconstruction | …" folding in
  the results table.
- Title page content: agency logo, project information card, evaluated-by /
  reviewed-by blocks with signature lines, disclaimer, 3psLCCA footer.
- Appendix A text, Appendix B glossary, equations and tables B-1…B-10.
- Section selection (the same checkboxes as before).
- Behaviour for GLOBAL traffic mode (paragraph instead of the India tables,
  no Appendix C) and for projects without calculation results (input
  sections only).

## What is different (and whether it matters)

| Difference | Why | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Pages are laid out in the browser before printing** | A web page has no pages until it is printed and CSS cannot ask "which page am I on", so the report is laid out into pages in the browser (Paged.js) and those pages are printed. A plain continuous view is one click away (**Continuous view**) but has no page numbers. | ~2–3 s of layout when the report opens. Front matter is numbered i, ii, …; the body restarts at 1, like the LaTeX report. |
| **Layout is similar, not identical** | Browser typesetting vs TeX: line breaks, page breaks and table widths differ; the PDF is 34 pages instead of 38 (browser tables are more compact, figures scale to width). | Cosmetic. Numbers and structure are identical. |
| **Saving the PDF is a print dialog**, not an automatic download | The browser writes the PDF; the user picks "Save as PDF" (the file name is pre-filled). | Workflow change. A one-click download is possible later with a JS PDF writer if wanted. |
| **Charts are vector drawings** (same code as the Results page) instead of matplotlib PNGs | No Python needed. | Sharper in print; visual style matches the on-screen Results page rather than matplotlib. |
| **Appendix C prints on a landscape page** via CSS named pages | Same intent as the LaTeX `landscape` environment. | Chromium/Edge honour mixed page sizes; Firefox and Safari may print that page portrait with the table scaled down. |
| Very long table rows are never split, and a table header repeats on each printed page | Print CSS rules. | Generally better than LaTeX's `longtable` continuation notes. |
| Remarks/notes fields are printed as plain text | Same as the LaTeX pipeline (`html_to_latex` strips formatting). | None. |

## How the two reports are offered

- **View Report** on the Results page opens the standard (HTML) report. This
  is the default for everyone.
- The LaTeX pipeline is untouched and lives under **Advanced** on the Results
  page as **Generate desktop-identical PDF**. It is switched off by default; a
  user can enable it there or in **Settings → Reports**, and can also make it
  the main button (the standard report then stays one click away). An ⓘ
  button explains both options in plain language. On computers that report
  4 GB of memory or less the option carries a warning. Choices are stored per
  browser.

## Open decision

1. Is "Print → Save as PDF" acceptable, or is a one-click download required?
